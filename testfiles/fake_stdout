SUMMARY
=======
Analysis of transcripts that overlap multiple genes:
  1 transcript (1.4%) with no matching reference contig
  18 transcripts (25.4%) overlap with 0 genes each
  34 transcripts (47.9%) overlap with 1 gene each
  13 transcripts (18.3%) overlap with 2 genes each
  5 transcripts (7.0%) overlap with 3 genes each
  ------------------------
  71 transcripts total

  5 intergenic regions removed, including 4 associated intergenic transcripts.

Transcripts on adjacent genes that overlap:
  11 intergenic regions fixed.
    7 on adjacent genes (possibly including intergenics).
    4 purely from overlaps with intergenic transcripts.
  10 associated intergenic transcripts removed.
