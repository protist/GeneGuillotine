SUMMARY
=======
Transcripts that overlap multiple genes:
  1 transcript (1.1%) with no matching reference contig
  22 transcripts (24.2%) overlap with 0 genes each
  36 transcripts (39.6%) overlap with 1 gene each
  23 transcripts (25.3%) overlap with 2 genes each
  9 transcripts (9.9%) overlap with 3 genes each
  ------------------------
  91 transcripts total

  6 intergenic regions removed, including 6 associated intergenic transcripts.

Transcripts on adjacent genes that overlap:
  8 intergenic regions fixed.
    6 on adjacent genes (possibly including intergenics).
    2 purely from overlaps with intergenic transcripts.
  8 associated intergenic transcripts removed.
