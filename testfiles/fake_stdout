SUMMARY
=======
Analysis of transcripts that overlap multiple genes:
  1 transcript (1.4%) with no matching reference contig
  18 transcripts (24.7%) overlap with 0 genes each
  34 transcripts (46.6%) overlap with 1 gene each
  13 transcripts (17.8%) overlap with 2 genes each
  6 transcripts (8.2%) overlap with 3 genes each
  1 transcript (1.4%) overlap with 4 genes each
  ------------------------
  73 transcripts total

  8 intergenic regions removed, including 4 associated intergenic transcripts.

Transcripts on adjacent genes that overlap:
  11 intergenic regions fixed.
    7 on adjacent genes (possibly including intergenics).
    4 purely from overlaps with intergenic transcripts.
  10 associated intergenic transcripts removed.
