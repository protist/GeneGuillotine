SUMMARY
=======
Transcripts that overlap multiple genes:
  1 transcript (1.6%) with no matching reference contig
  15 transcripts (23.8%) overlap with 0 genes each
  30 transcripts (47.6%) overlap with 1 gene each
  12 transcripts (19.0%) overlap with 2 genes each
  5 transcripts (7.9%) overlap with 3 genes each
  ------------------------
  63 transcripts total

  4 intergenic regions removed, including 3 associated intergenic transcripts.

Transcripts on adjacent genes that overlap:
  8 intergenic regions fixed.
    6 on adjacent genes (possibly including intergenics).
    2 purely from overlaps with intergenic transcripts.
  8 associated intergenic transcripts removed.
